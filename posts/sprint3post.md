# Slice It Sprint 3

## What did you work on this week?
* I finished up the Games List and integrate the API from the server using the Axios Library. 
  
## What did you learn?
* I was learning about utilizing the Axios Library which is very useful when you're on the front end and trying to make calls to the server. I also learned a bit about developing while designs were being implemented.

## What was difficult?
* The most difficult part was learning to adapt and be agile to changes. This concept changed the way I think and how I code. I wanted to work around being regressive and adaptable.

## What was effective about both your personal and your group's workflow? Ineffective?
* Again, the effective part about my personal workflow is that I'm working alone so there is no one blocking me (yet) and I am able to code and develop at full speed. My group is working towards a consistent file structure and having more communication, definitely better than last week.
