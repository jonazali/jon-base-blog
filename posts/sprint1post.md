# Slice It Sprint 1

## What did you work on this week?
* Our main focus was on deeper development of the user flow and the design of our webpage. We wanted to use the "design before develop" approach to our web application. Personally I help contribute to the design of our landing page and our user flow pages. I also created several logo designs as a prototype to our brand.
  
## What did you learn?
* I learned that there are several different ways to program through this "design before develop". Sometimes using different ways to program allows you to develop in a more flexible way. Before I use to program and design as I go but this way allows me to implement our front end code much easier.

## What was difficult?
* The most difficult part was the beginning and brain storming because having a group of such diverse people and different ideas can create frictions in the start of brain storming.

## What was effective about both your personal and your group's workflow? Ineffective?
* The effective part about our group's workflow is our cohesion because we have worked together before and we have similiar personalities we are able to work without friction. The ineffective part would be communication personally I feel I need to communicate my thoughts out more during group presentations and make sure I take in other's thoughts during this process.
