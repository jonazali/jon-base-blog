# Slice It Sprint 2

## What did you work on this week?
* I focused on the list of games page this week. After extensive designs I was able to implement this in code. I wanted to use higher order functions to simplify my coding and producing cleaner code. I also wanted to take this opportunity to improve my commenting for others to see.
  
## What did you learn?
* Again with the concept of design before develop is very helpful in this sprint because I have a reference to look to and a design to aim after. I hope my developed code matches the design by the next sprint.

## What was difficult?
* The most difficult part is re-teaching yourself to produce react apps and learning how to implement it because getting complacent with frameworks caused me to forget some of the skills I have learned or produced.

## What was effective about both your personal and your group's workflow? Ineffective?
* The effective part about my personal workflow is that I'm working alone so there is no one blocking me (yet) and I am able to code and develop at full speed. My group's workflow however could use some more work for example, learning to stay consistent with style guides and file structure.
